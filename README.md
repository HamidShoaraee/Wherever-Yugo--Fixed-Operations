# Wherever-Yugo--Fixed-Operations-
System Analysis And Design Project 
The purpose of this project is for the systems analyst to recommend an ERP system for the Fixed Operations departments, specifically the Service department and its tertiary interaction with Parts. The existing system, which is at the end of its life cycle, will be discontinued by the manufacturer in 2 years and is not the best tool for the job.  
# Project Goals 
Improve efficiency by eliminating lag time between departments 
Provide a cost reduction by eliminating waste and increasing productivity 
Improve the quality of employee and customer experience by placing less onus on Service Advisors for all work order functions allowing them to be proactive rather than reactive which in turn influences the next point 
Improve profitability (increased hours per RO-detailed in the interim report) 
Eliminate decentralization by providing an integrated view of company data  
 As time and budget are guiding factors, SDLC methodology will be used for implementation.

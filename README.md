# Wherever-Yugo, System Analysis And Design Project
 
The purpose of this project is for the systems analyst to recommend an ERP system for the Fixed Operations departments, specifically the Service department and its tertiary interaction with Parts. The existing system, which is at the end of its life cycle, will be discontinued by the manufacturer in 2 years and is not the best tool for the job. 

# Project Goals 
**1. Improve efficiency by eliminating lag time between departments.** 

**2. Provide a cost reduction by eliminating waste and increasing productivity.**

**3. Improve the quality of employee and customer experience by placing less onus on Service Advisors for all work order functions allowing them to be proactive rather than reactive which in turn influences the next point.**

**4. Improve profitability.**

**5. Eliminate decentralization by providing an integrated view of company data.**

**6. As time and budget are guiding factors, SDLC methodology will be used for implementation.**

# Insight 
In the previous system the Service Advisor being responsible for all the information input and data wrangling , this task is now divided between service (advisor and technician) and parts department under umbrella of the new integrated system. 

The new system is presented in the **information_system.ipynb** file improves the profitability by optimizing the previous information system in various aspects. This Notebook presents the **summary** of our group study through this project.
